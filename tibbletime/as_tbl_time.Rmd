library(tibbletime)
```


as_tbl_time Create tbl_time objects

### Description

tbl_time objects have a time index that contains information about which column should be used for time-based subsetting and other time-based manipulation. Otherwise, they function as normal tibbles.

#### Usage
<pre><code>
as_tbl_time(x, index = NULL, ...)
tbl_time(x, index = NULL)
</code></pre

### Arguments
* x An object to be converted to tbl_time. This is generally a tibble::tibble(), or an object that can first be coerced to a tibble.
* index The bare column name of the column to be used as the index.
* ... Arguments passed to tibble::as_tibble() if coercion is necessary first.

### Details
The information stored about tbl_time objects are the index_quo and the index_time_zone.
These are stored as attributes, with the index_quo as a rlang::quosure() and the time_zone as a string.
Currently, Date and POSIXct classes are fully supported. yearmon, yearqtr, and hms have experimental support. Due to dplyrâ€™s handling of S3 classes like these 3, the classes are lost when you manipulate the index columns directly.

#### Examples
```{r}
# Converting a data.frame to a `tbl_time`
# Using Date index
ex1 <- data.frame(date = Sys.Date(), value = 1)
ex1_tbl_time <- as_tbl_time(ex1, date)
```

```{r}

class(ex1_tbl_time)
attributes(ex1_tbl_time)
# Converting a tibble to a `tbl_time`
# Using POSIXct index
ex2 <- tibble::tibble(
time = as.POSIXct(c("2017-01-01 10:12:01", "2017-01-02 12:12:01")),
value = c(1, 2)
)
as_tbl_time(ex2, time)
```
