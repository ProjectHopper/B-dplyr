Description
The period is parsed into frequency and period and returned as a named list.
Usage

Arguments
period A character specification used for time-based grouping. The general format to
use is "frequency period" where frequency is a number like 1 or 2, and period
is an interval like weekly or yearly. There must be a space between the two.
Note that you can pass the specification in a flexible way:
â€¢ 1 Year: '1 year' / '1 Y' / '1 yearly' / 'yearly'
This shorthand is available for year, quarter, month, day, hour, minute, second,
millisecond and microsecond periodicities.
Additionally, you have the option of passing in a vector of dates to use as custom
and more flexible boundaries.
Examples
parse_period('2 day')
