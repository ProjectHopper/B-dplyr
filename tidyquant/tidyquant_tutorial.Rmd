tidyquant package
================
The tidyquant package is focused on retrieving, manipulating, and scaling financial data analysis in the easiest way possible. 
To get the tidyquant package and start working with it, you first have to install it.
install.packages("tidyquant")
This places it on your local computer. You then have to load it into your current R session. 
This gives you access to all of the functions in the package.
library(tidyquant)
These steps of installing and librarying packages are necessary for any CRAN package you want to use.
The exercise code is already written for you. You will explore some of the functions that tidyquant has for financial analysis.


The code is already written, but these instructions will walk you through the steps.
First, library the package to access its functions.
Use the tidyquant function, tq_get() to get the stock price data for Apple.
Take a look at the data frame it returned.
Plot the stock price over time.
Calculate daily returns for the adjusted stock price using tq_mutate(). This function "mutates" your data frame by 
adding a new column onto it. Here, that new column is the daily returns.
Sort the returns.
Plot the sorted returns. You can see that Apple had a few days of losses >10%, and a number of days with gains of >5%.
